# Telecom-ml-customer-churn-prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques and improve model performance by addressing class imbalance.
The dataset consists of customer data, including demographic, service usage, and account information.
Tools Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, and Streamlit for web app deployment.


Features and Implementation
Model Training: Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for churn prediction,PCA
Class Imbalance Handling: Used SMOTEENN (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors) to balance the dataset and enhance model performance.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Web App: Developed an interactive Streamlit application allowing users to input customer data and get churn predictions with confidence scores.

I have attached a glimpise of working of the model please do check out. 

thank you
i am open for feedbacks or any corrections.
