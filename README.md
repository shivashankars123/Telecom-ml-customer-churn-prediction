README: Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This Customer Churn Prediction project helps businesses predict whether customers will churn or continue using their services. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project helps companies take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

Problem Statement
Churn prediction is a significant challenge for businesses, especially in the telecommunications sector. With customers constantly evaluating their options, predicting customer churn enables businesses to focus on retention strategies. This project provides an automated solution to predict churn using customer data.

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing:
Loaded and cleaned the customer data from CSV files.
Handled missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Model Building:
Used Decision Trees, Random Forests, and other machine learning techniques to build predictive models.
SMOTE for Data Imbalance:
Applied SMOTEENN for handling class imbalance in churn data.
Prediction Function:
Built a function to predict churn based on customer data inputs.
Real-time Prediction:
Developed a user-friendly interface with Streamlit to allow real-time input and predictions.
Key Features
Predictive models that classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
Real-time customer churn prediction via Streamlit app.
Built with a user-friendly interface for easy testing and interaction.
Challenges Faced
Data Imbalance: Tackled using SMOTE for better prediction reliability.
Feature Engineering: Optimized customer data features for better model accuracy.
UI Development: Worked with Shreehari to design and develop a seamless UI for the application.
Future Improvements
Implement deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
Scale the system to handle larger datasets and real-time data processing.
Expand the system to integrate with customer databases for live predictions.
Acknowledgments
